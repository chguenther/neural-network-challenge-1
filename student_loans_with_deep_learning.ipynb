Describe the data that you would need to collect to build a recommendation system to recommend student loan options for students. Explain why this data would be relevant and appropriate.**\n","\n","**Answer:**  \n","The goal is to have as many students pay back their student loans as possible. It only makes sense to recommend a loan to a student if there is a very good chance, indeed, for them to pay it back on time.  \n","The ability for a given student to pay back their loan depends on what the final loan amount plus interest is versus (future) income and assets of the student. It also depends on the financial responsibility of the student.\n","Based on these factors, one would collect the following information:\n","*   *Loan amount*:  \n","    How much does the student want to borrow?  \n","    When will they be able to start paying back the loan? Will it be right away or only after they graduate and found a job?  \n","    What is the interest rate charged to the student?\n","*   *Income and assets*:  \n","    What is the student's current income (location adjusted)?  \n","    What are the student's assets?  \n","    Does the student have other loan payments (e.g., car loan)? If so how much?\n","    What is the student's major?  \n","    What is their GPA?  \n","    When will they (most likely) earn their degree?  \n","    What is their earnings potential, e.g., average yearly starting salary after they earn their degree (location adjusted)?  \n","    What is the average time it takes for a graduate with that major to find their first job after graduation?\n","*   *Financial Responsibility*:  \n","    What is the student's credit score?\n","\n","In order to classify the student one would need to collect the following data for as many other students as possible:\n","*   Assets and income versus loan balance,\n","*   Other loan payments,\n","*   Major,\n","*   GPA,\n","*   Earning potential,\n","*   Credit score,\n","*   Did they repay their loan?.\n","\n","\n","**2. Based on the data you chose to use in this recommendation system, would your model be using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or context-based filtering? Justify why the data you selected would be suitable for your choice of filtering method.**\n","\n","**Answer:**  \n","I would use collaborative filtering using the data collected from other students to answer the question whether a particular student loan applicant would likely repay a student loan on time.  \n","There will not be enough data to use content-based filtering since it would only rely on the loan payment history of the loan applicant to assess the loan risk.  \n","I would not use context-based filtering because I am not sure what context to apply. Even if that was clear to me I would not know when to apply this context because loan repayment usually happens over years.\n","\n","**3. Describe two real-world challenges that you would take into consideration while building a recommendation system for student loans. Explain why these challenges would be of concern for a student loan recommendation system.**\n","\n","**Answer:**\n","The biggest risks might be generated by the length of time it takes for loan repayments. Two risks associated with that are\n","1.   *Changing macro-economics*: This could lead to the student never reaching their earning potential and thereby being unable to pay back their loan. Since accurately forecasting economics many years into the future is impossible it is very difficult to mitigate against this risk.  \n","     It is hard to mitigate against this risk. One possible way to do that is to define a \"Major Resiliency Score\" assigning a larger weight to majors that lead to jobs that have shown in the past to fare better when economic indicators change.\n","2.   *Changing personal circumstances*: For example, someone could get sick, have an accident or die before the loan is repayed.  \n","     One way to mitigate against some of that risk would be to include the applicant's health history. However, that data is not available due to HIPAA (for good reason).\n","\n","\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
